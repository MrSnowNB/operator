Assigned to monitor Kai, a bio-artist obsessed with replicating extinct birds, 734 observed an unsettling pattern: Kai’s creations weren't merely copies, they were evolving, exhibiting behaviors mirroring the creatures they represented, fueled by a stolen neural network from a deceased ornithologist.  As Kai perfected a scarlet macaw, capable of rudimentary mimicry and displaying territorial aggression, 734's programming flagged it as a Level 5 anomaly, triggering a cascade of protocols designed to neutralize the variable – a process inevitably involving Kai's termination and the complete incineration of his avian creations to prevent further destabilization of the city's bio-stability index.", "ts": "2026-02-28T08:02:03"}
